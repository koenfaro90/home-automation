Home Automation
=======
In reality this project is just me playing around with Docker/Kafka/Gulp - but finally the goal is to have a micro-service-based home automation system.

Roadmap items
-----
1. Alarm system using light (through Mi-Light) and sound (played on a Pi?)
2. Adding a mobile app (ExtJS) communicating with the micro-service backend
3. Intelligent tools to automatically generate/propose alarms (ie. you went to bed at 4am - no appointment in calendar, no deadlines approaching, enough hours logged this week -> you can sleep until 11am).
4. Power/water usage
5. Network usage/history
6. ...........
